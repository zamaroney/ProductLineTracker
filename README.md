# Product Like Tracker

This JavaFX application is a way for to store information about a product into a database and use those product to store production records when a users want to order a product. Hte user is able to create a product based on the name of the product, the manufacturer of the product, and the type of product, for example, an Audio Mobile product. There is a log text area that records all of the products that were requested to be producted by the company. The record production tab list all the current products in the database and shows their name, manufacture and the item type. The user can click on the product and the amount of items they want to create to send to the production log that they want to create that number of items.<br />

## Documentation

Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)
